  "readme": "Object Additions\n================================================================================\n\n**Object Additions** is a set `Object` utility methods. This package plays nice with others by not forcing you to \"pollute\" the global `Object` object. On the other hand, it provides a means to add them to the global `Object` object, if that's how you roll.\n\nIf you opt-in to adding these methods to the global `Object` object, each of them will only be added if members don't already exist with their given name.\n\nThe current suite includes:\n\n* `isString`\n* `isNumber`\n* `isUndefined`\n* `isDate`\n* `isFunction`\n* `extend`\n* `values`\n\nUsage\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get a reference to the additions, while NOT modifying the global `Object` object, just require the package:\n\n    var additions = require(\"object-additions\").object;\n    additions.isString(\"hi\");\n    // -> true\n\nIf, on the other hand, you _want_ to just add these to the global `Object` object, call the `add` method:\n\n    require(\"object-additions\").add();\n    Object.isString(\"hi\");\n    // -> true\n\nThese additions are inspired (and sometimes directly copied from) Prototype.js\n\nInstallation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrab a copy of the source, and require it in your app:\n\n    require(\"./path/to/object-additions\").add();\n\nOr install it with NPM:\n\n    $ npm install object-additions\n\nThen require it in your app: \n\n    require(\"object-additions\").add();\n",
